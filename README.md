# ECG Classification Using Deep Learning

This repository focuses on ECG classification using deep learning techniques. The original version of this repository can be found [here](original_repository_link). It features the PyTorch implementation of the ResNet model developed by Between_a_ROC_and_a_heart_place. The model was initially designed for the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020 and was presented in the paper titled "Adaptive Lead Weighted ResNet Trained With Different Duration Signals for Classifying 12-lead ECGs," accepted at CinC2020.

This version of the repository has been refactored to support more general analysis and usage.

## Usage

To get started, install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
