# ECG Classification using Deep Learning

This repository is dedicated to the classification of ECG signals using deep learning techniques. The original version of this repository is available [here](https://github.com/ZhaoZhibin/Physionet2020model). It features a PyTorch implementation of the ResNet model developed by *Between_a_ROC_and_a_heart_place* for the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020. The associated paper, titled "[**Adaptive Lead Weighted ResNet Trained With Different Duration Signals for Classifying 12-lead ECGs**](https://physionetchallenges.github.io/2020/papers/112.pdf)," was accepted by CinC2020.

This version of the repository has been refactored to accommodate a broader range of analysis tasks.

## Usage

To begin, install the required Python packages using the following command:
