Repository for ECG classification using deep learning techniques. This project aims to classify 12-lead ECG signals using the ResNet model architecture. The original model was designed for the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020.

**Note:** This is a refactored version of the original implementation by Between_a_ROC_and_a_heart_place. The original repository can be found [here](original_repository_link).
